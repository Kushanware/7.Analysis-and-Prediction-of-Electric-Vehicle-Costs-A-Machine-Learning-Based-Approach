# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers of the *Electric Vehicle Cost Analysis & Prediction* project pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyoneâ€”regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to fostering an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Specific Guidelines

- **Be open and inclusive.** We welcome anyone to participate in the project. Use public channels for communication where possible.
- **Be empathetic and respectful.** We value collaboration, patience, and understanding. We avoid personal attacks and assume good intentions.
- **Be constructive.** Provide clear, respectful feedback. Critique code or ideas, not people.
- **Be collaborative.** Acknowledge the value of othersâ€™ work. Recognize that every contribution matters.
- **Be inquisitive.** Donâ€™t hesitate to ask questions. Curiosity drives better solutions.
